        <h2>Who is Beth Hart?</h2>
        <p>Beth Hart is an American singer, songwriter and musician from Los Angeles. She rose to fame with the release of her 1999 single "LA Song (Out of This Town)". The single was a number one hit in New Zealand, and reached the top five on the US Adult Contemporary chart, and number 7 on the Billboard Adult Top 40 Chart.</p>
        <p>Hart's first album with Bonamassa, Don't Explain, went gold in the Netherlands. In 2014 Hart was nominated for a Grammy Award for Seesaw and she was also nominated for a Blues Music Award in the category 'Best Contemporary Blues Female Artist'.</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://jbonamassa.com/who-is-beth-hart/">
        So who is Beth Hart? Sheâ€™s a first class musician, a keeper of the blues flame, a vocal dynamo, and someone who we deeply hope continues to channel her deep connection to the human spirit into spectacular music for years and years to come.

        <h2>About this assignment</h2>
        <p>I agree with the idea that a website is never truly finished, and the same applies to this assignment. Given the time I would add styles for portrait view, make some nice css animations for buttons to be more prominent and answer a few more questions, and maybe I will later.</p>
        <p>But given the time shortage on my side this is my Minimum Viable Product for this afternoon, hope you enjoyed it.</p>
